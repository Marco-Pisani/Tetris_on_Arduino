# Tetris_on_Arduino
Tetris on ATMEGA328P (Arduino Uno) for VGA output

# story
It was an university project and was really useful to learn about microcontrollers programming, in particular:
-  reading and understanding datasheets (using interrupts, timers, ...)
-  understanding how C is translated into assembly
-  VGA standard
-  reading documentation on libriaries

# requirements
Arduino Uno board, usb cable and some basic electronic components (cables, resistors, buttons) to connect the board to the VGA display and to create circuits for buttons
